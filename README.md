# Vue CLI diff

This repository exposes an Vue CLI app generated with
`vue create ponyracer` with each version of Vue CLI.

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/cexbrayat/vue-cli-diff/compare/4.1.2...4.1.3

See table below for the complete list.

Note that this is inspired by [RN diff](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff).

This is a small project that we needed to keep our ebook [Become a ninja with Vue](https://books.ninja-squad.com/vue)
and our [online training about Vue](https://vue-exercises.ninja-squad.com) up to date,
we hope it can be useful for you too!

## Why this repository ?

After an upgrade of Vue CLI on your project, you'll have to keep the configuration up-to-date, and it can be hard to keep track.

This project lets you easily know what changed. For example, from
[4.1.2 to the 4.1.3](https://github.com/cexbrayat/vue-cli-diff/compare/4.1.2...4.1.3).

It uses a set of options that might differ from yours (TypeScript with no classes, Jest, Cypress),
but it can be useful anyway to see the layout and configuration changes.
